# Abstract
This report presents insights into the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for early congestion prediction in Integrated Circuit (IC) design. Utilizing the NCSU-DigIC-GraphData dataset, which includes 13 unique netlists with distinct congestion characteristics, our methodology includes node feature engineering, graph train-test split, and a comparison between model architectures, such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs). Results show that Graph Neural Networks do not scale well on small netlists that only contain a few thousand nodes. GATs can perform better than GCNs but with significantly longer training time. Moreover, GRC-based prediction models are inferior to node-based prediction models.
